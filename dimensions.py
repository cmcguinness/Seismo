# --- Geophone: LGT-4.5 bare 1" element (measured / confirmed) ---

geophone_height = 36.0    # body height (mm)
geophone_mass_g = 74      # informs base-mass / coupling reasoning
# Bottom : flat outer rim + central recessed hole -> seats on rim; a small
#          centering boss on the pocket floor can nose into the recess.
# Top    : offset green terminal board with two protruding solder pins
#          (one marked +) and a lead wire -> clamp must clear the center
#          and route the wire out the side.

# --- Neutrik D-series XLR chassis connector (NC3MD-L-B / NC3FD-L-B) ---
xlr_bore_dia = 24.0       # standardized "D" panel cutout — this number is reliable

xlr_body_depth = 32.0     # intrusion behind the panel — this sets the case inner width
# NOTE: the two M3 flange-hole positions are deliberately NOT modeled. Their spacing
# is not confirmed and a wrong printed pattern scraps a whole case print. Mark them
# through the connector by hand and drill 2.5 mm. See parts/geophone_case.py.
